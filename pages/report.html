  <h2 id="title"> Load time Increase? </h2>

  <p id="margin-left">
    Something I noticed from the dashboard was that it seems like
    the load time increases after about 1654647408900 (ms) or Tue Jun 
    07 2022 17:16:48. This is
    at about 220 on the bar chart on the dashboard. It seems a little
    bit more clear on a line chart than a bar chart that this is the 
    case. The question I have is that I don't exactly know why
    this is the case. I initially thought that this increase in load
    times was because I switched over to using a laptop but after 
    looking at the date I realized this increase in load time was after
    I updated the website. Right around this time I updated the main page 
    of my website and it seems like there has been noticeable differences
    in the load times.
