# Node-Login-System
Created login web app for Reporting Dashboard Backend

## Libraries Used
Express, Passport, Bcrpt, Mysql

## How it works
The program uses Passport in conjunction with Bcrypt to login the user with a hashed password check. The hashed passwords are stored within a MySQL Database which can be updated using the CRUD routes at the end of the program.

## CRUD
crud routes allow for the admin to Create, Read, Update, and Delete users, user passwords, and priveleges.
