# Node-Login-System
Created Analytics Dashboard as a web app.

## Libraries Used
Express, Passport, Bcrpt, Mysql

## Login System
The program uses Passport in conjunction with Bcrypt to login the user with a hashed password check. The hashed passwords are stored within a MySQL Database which can be updated using the CRUD routes at the end of the program (only accessible to admin users).

## CRUD
crud routes allow for the admin to Create, Read, Update, and Delete users, user passwords, and priveleges.
